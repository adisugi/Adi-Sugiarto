# [Project 1 : Bussines Decision Research](https://github.com/adisugi/portofolio/tree/main/project1)
This project provided by [DQlab](https://www.dqlab.id/), with the case :
- There is a store which sell the sport necessities like jackets, clothes, bags and shoes since 2013. So it has customers from the started on.
- At the beginning of 2019 the store got a decrease of customers. if a customer have no transaction for 6 month ago, it's defined as churn.
- Here we should making some analysis based on transaction data from the store own.

The datasets, contains 100000 rows with 2 first columns are increment indexes. Here some analysis and visualization was made, its like :
- Determined the churn customers
- Customer number per year (year first transaction)
- Transaction number per year (year first transaction)
- Average transaction amount per year (year first transaction) for each item
- Churn proportion, and so forth

Here was also created a model using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to classifing the customers is churn or not.
The accuracy results for both training and test model is about 0.76
